It is possible that you do not want to receive all published content in the blog.

You can subscribe via _RSS_ in a _tag/category_ basis, this means:

- The main feed, for which you will receive all posted content is located at **<a href="/en/index.xml" target="_blank">/en/index.xml</a>**.
- For each _category/tag_ there is a feed, for example, in [/en/categories/linux](/en/categories/linux)__ is the feed [/en/categories/linux/index.xml](/en/categories/linux/index.xml).
- It happens the same for _tags_, for example [/en/tags/gentoo/](/en/tags/gentoo/) has feed [/en/tags/gentoo/index.xml](/en/tags/gentoo/index.xml).
